📰 News App
An  Android application built using the latest technologies and best practices, designed to deliver news content in a clean, responsive, and performant way.

🧱 Tech Stack
Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

Dependency Injection: Hilt

Networking: Retrofit

Asynchronous Programming: Kotlin Coroutines

UI Framework: Jetpack Compose

AI Assistance: Gemini AI

⚙️ Architecture
The app follows the MVVM architecture to separate UI logic from business and data layers, ensuring maintainable and testable code. ViewModels manage UI-related data and handle state in a lifecycle-aware manner.

🔌 Dependency Injection
Hilt is used for injecting dependencies across the app, streamlining object creation and promoting cleaner code by reducing boilerplate.

🌐 Networking
Retrofit handles communication with remote APIs, while Kotlin Coroutines manage asynchronous operations to ensure smooth performance and responsiveness.

🎨 UI with Jetpack Compose
The entire UI is built using Jetpack Compose, Android’s modern declarative UI toolkit. This allows for:

Faster UI development

Cleaner and more concise code

Reactive and state-driven components
